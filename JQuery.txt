JQuery Selectores:
jQuery selectors allow you to select and manipulate HTML element(s).

jQuery selectors are used to "find"(or select) HTML element based on their name,id, classes, types, attributes, values ofattributes and much more.
It is based on the existing CSS Selectors, and in addition, it has some own customer selectors.

all selector in jQuery start with the dollar sign and parentheses: $().

The element Selector
The jQuery element selector selects elements based on the element name.

You can select all <p> elements on a page like this:

$("p")
Example

When a user clicks on a button, all <p> elements will be hidden:

The #id Selector
The jQuery #id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML tag to find the specific element.

An id should be unique within a page, so you should use the #id selector when you want to find a single, unique element.

To find an element with a specific id, write a hash character, followed by the id of the HTML element:

$("#test")
Example

When a user clicks on a button, the element with id="test" will be hidden:


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script>
$(document).ready(function(){
  $("button").click(function(){
    $("#test").hide();
  });
});
</script>
</head>
<body>

<h2>This is a heading</h2>

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p id="test">This is another paragraph.</p>

<button>Click me</button>

</body>
</html>


The .class Selector
The jQuery .class selector finds elements with a specific class.

To find elements with a specific class, write a period character, followed by the name of the class:

$(".test")
Example

When a user clicks on a button, the elements with class="test" will be hidden:

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script>
$(document).ready(function(){
  $("button").click(function(){
    $(".test").hide();
  });
});
</script>
</head>
<body>

<h2 class="test">This is a heading</h2>

<p class="test">This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>

<button>Click me</button>

</body>
</html>
